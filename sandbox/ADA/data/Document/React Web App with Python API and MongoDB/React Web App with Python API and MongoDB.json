The architecture is ideal for modern web applications requiring dynamic user interfaces, scalable backend services, and flexible NoSQL database storage. Typical use cases include e-commerce platforms, social media applications, and content management systems. This document outlines the major components required to deploy this workload on Microsoft Azure.\\n\\n### Major Components\\n\\n* **Resource Group** - A logical container for all resources in this architecture. It simplifies management and billing by grouping related resources together.\\n\\n* **Azure App Service for React Web App** - This service hosts the React web application, providing a scalable and managed platform for running front-end code. It ensures high availability and supports CI/CD pipelines for seamless deployment.\\n\\n* **Azure App Service for Python API** - This service hosts the Python-based API backend, enabling RESTful communication between the front-end and database. It supports scaling based on demand and integrates with monitoring tools for performance tracking.\\n\\n* **Azure Cosmos DB (MongoDB API)** - This resource provides a globally distributed, highly available NoSQL database that supports MongoDB APIs. It is used to store application data, such as user profiles, transactions, or content.\\n\\n* **Azure Application Insights** - This service monitors the performance and health of both the React web app and Python API, providing actionable insights for debugging and optimization.\\n\\n* **Azure Virtual Network (optional)** - If required, a virtual network can be used to securely connect resources, such as the API backend and database, ensuring private communication.\\n\\n### Decision Points\\n\\nIn this architecture, users will encounter several decision points that can significantly impact the performance, cost, and scalability of the deployment. These include:\\n\\n1. **App Service Plan SKU**: Users must choose the appropriate SKU for hosting the React web app and Python API. Factors include the expected traffic, performance requirements, and budget. For example, a Basic SKU may suffice for development, while a Premium SKU might be needed for production.\\n\\n2. **Cosmos DB Configuration**: Decisions include the choice of throughput (manual or autoscale), global distribution, and indexing policies. These choices depend on the application's data access patterns and scalability needs.\\n\\n3. **Application Insights Configuration**: Users must decide the level of monitoring required. For example, enabling advanced telemetry may increase costs but provide deeper insights into application performance.\\n\\n4. **Networking**: If using a Virtual Network, users need to configure subnets, network security groups, and private endpoints. This is especially important for applications with strict security requirements.\\n\\n5. **Scaling Strategy**: Both the App Services and Cosmos DB support autoscaling. Users must decide on scaling thresholds and limits based on anticipated workloads.\\n\\nThese decision points will be expanded upon later in the document to help users tailor the architecture to their specific needs.\\n\\n### Alternatives\\n\\nWhile this document focuses on deploying a React web app with a Python API and MongoDB on Azure, there are alternative approaches worth considering:\\n\\n1. **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: For applications requiring container orchestration, AKS can be used to deploy the React app, Python API, and MongoDB containers. This approach offers greater control and flexibility but requires more management effort.\\n\\n2. **Azure Functions**: For lightweight backend APIs, Azure Functions can replace the Python API App Service. This serverless option reduces costs for low-traffic applications but may not be suitable for complex APIs.\\n\\n3. **Azure SQL Database**: If a relational database is preferred over MongoDB, Azure SQL Database can be used. It offers robust querying capabilities and is ideal for structured data.\\n\\nThese alternatives may be chosen based on specific requirements, such as the need for containerization, serverless architecture, or relational data storage. Each option has trade-offs in terms of complexity, cost, and scalability.\"}}, {\"py/object\": \"document.Section\", \"name\": \"Deployment\", \"requires_test\": true, \"instance\": {\"py/object\": \"deployment.Deployment\", \"title\": \"Deployment - React Web App with Python API and MongoDB\", \"meta_data\": {}, \"content\": \"## Prerequisites\\n\\nThe following prerequisites are required before you are able to work through this document.\\n\\n- Az CLI is installed and you are logged in to an active Azure subscription.\\n\\n```bash\\nexport SUFFIX=$(date +%s%N | sha256sum | head -c 6)\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Step 1: Create Resource Group\\n\\nThe first step is to create a resource group, which acts as a logical container for all resources in this architecture. Resource groups simplify management and billing by grouping related resources together.\\n\\nDefine the environment variable for the resource group name and region.\\n\\n```bash\\nexport RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME_ED345=\\\"ReactPythonMongoRG_$SUFFIX\\\"\\nexport REGION_ED345=\\\"westus2\\\"\\n```\\n\\nCreate the resource group.\\n\\n```bash\\naz group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME_ED345 \\\\\\n    --location $REGION_ED345\\n```\\n\\nThis command will output results similar to the following.\\n\\n<!-- expected_similarity=0.3 -->\\n\\n```text\\n{\\n    \\\"id\\\": \\\"/subscriptions/xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx/resourceGroups/ReactPythonMongoRG_xxxxxx\\\",\\n    \\\"location\\\": \\\"westus2\\\",\\n    \\\"managedBy\\\": null,\\n    \\\"name\\\": \\\"ReactPythonMongoRG_xxxxxx\\\",\\n    \\\"properties\\\": {\\n        \\\"provisioningState\\\": \\\"Succeeded\\\"\\n    },\\n    \\\"tags\\\": null,\\n    \\\"type\\\": \\\"Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nResource groups are free to create, but the resources within them incur costs. Choose a region close to your user base to minimize latency and optimize performance.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Step 2: Deploy Azure App Service for React Web App\\n\\nThis step deploys an Azure App Service to host the React web application. Azure App Service provides a scalable and managed platform for running front-end code.\\n\\nDefine environment variables for the App Service plan and web app.\\n\\n```bash\\nexport APP_SERVICE_PLAN_NAME_ED345=\\\"ReactAppPlan_$SUFFIX\\\"\\nexport WEB_APP_NAME_ED345=\\\"ReactWebApp$SUFFIX\\\" # Removed underscore to comply with naming rules\\nexport APP_SERVICE_SKU_ED345=\\\"P1V2\\\" # Premium SKU for production workloads\\n```\\n\\nCreate the App Service plan.\\n\\n```bash\\naz appservice plan create --name $APP_SERVICE_PLAN_NAME_ED345 \\\\\\n    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME_ED345 \\\\\\n    --sku $APP_SERVICE_SKU_ED345 \\\\\\n    --is-linux\\n```\\n\\nCreate the web app.\\n\\n```bash\\naz webapp create --name $WEB_APP_NAME_ED345 \\\\\\n    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME_ED345 \\\\\\n    --plan $APP_SERVICE_PLAN_NAME_ED345 \\\\\\n    --runtime \\\"NODE|16-lts\\\"\\n```\\n\\nThis command will output results similar to the following.\\n\\n<!-- expected_similarity=0.3 -->\\n\\n```text\\n{\\n    \\\"id\\\": \\\"/subscriptions/xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx/resourceGroups/ReactPythonMongoRG_xxxxxx/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/ReactWebAppxxxxxx\\\",\\n    \\\"name\\\": \\\"ReactWebAppxxxxxx\\\",\\n    \\\"state\\\": \\\"Running\\\",\\n    \\\"hostNames\\\": [\\n        \\\"ReactWebAppxxxxxx.azurewebsites.net\\\"\\n    ],\\n    \\\"type\\\": \\\"Microsoft.Web/sites\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nFor production workloads, consider higher SKUs for better performance and scaling. Lower SKUs may suffice for development or testing environments.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Step 3: Deploy Azure App Service for Python API\\n\\nThis step deploys an Azure App Service to host the Python-based API backend. This service enables RESTful communication between the front-end and database.\\n\\nDefine environment variables for the API App Service plan and web app.\\n\\n```bash\\nexport API_APP_SERVICE_PLAN_NAME_ED345=\\\"PythonAPIPlan_$SUFFIX\\\"\\nexport API_WEB_APP_NAME_ED345=\\\"PythonAPIApp$SUFFIX\\\" # Removed underscore to comply with naming rules\\nexport API_APP_SERVICE_SKU_ED345=\\\"P1V2\\\" # Premium SKU for production workloads\\n```\\n\\nCreate the App Service plan.\\n\\n```bash\\naz appservice plan create --name $API_APP_SERVICE_PLAN_NAME_ED345 \\\\\\n    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME_ED345 \\\\\\n    --sku $API_APP_SERVICE_SKU_ED345 \\\\\\n    --is-linux\\n```\\n\\nCreate the web app.\\n\\n```bash\\naz webapp create --name $API_WEB_APP_NAME_ED345 \\\\\\n    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME_ED345 \\\\\\n    --plan $API_APP_SERVICE_PLAN_NAME_ED345 \\\\\\n    --runtime \\\"PYTHON|3.9\\\"\\n```\\n\\nThis command will output results similar to the following.\\n\\n<!-- expected_similarity=0.3 -->\\n\\n```text\\n{\\n    \\\"id\\\": \\\"/subscriptions/xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx/resourceGroups/ReactPythonMongoRG_xxxxxx/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/PythonAPIAppxxxxxx\\\",\\n    \\\"name\\\": \\\"PythonAPIAppxxxxxx\\\",\\n    \\\"state\\\": \\\"Running\\\",\\n    \\\"hostNames\\\": [\\n        \\\"PythonAPIAppxxxxxx.azurewebsites.net\\\"\\n    ],\\n    \\\"type\\\": \\\"Microsoft.Web/sites\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nEnsure the runtime version matches your Python application requirements. Premium SKUs provide better scaling and performance for high-demand APIs.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Step 4: Deploy Azure Cosmos DB (MongoDB API)\\n\\nThis step deploys Azure Cosmos DB configured with the MongoDB API to store application data.\\n\\nDefine environment variables for the Cosmos DB account.\\n\\n```bash\\nexport COSMOS_DB_ACCOUNT_NAME_ED345=\\\"mongodbacct$SUFFIX\\\" # Adjusted name to comply with naming rules\\nexport COSMOS_DB_THROUGHPUT_ED345=\\\"400\\\" # Throughput in RU/s\\n```\\n\\nCreate the Cosmos DB account.\\n\\n```bash\\naz cosmosdb create --name $COSMOS_DB_ACCOUNT_NAME_ED345 \\\\\\n    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME_ED345 \\\\\\n    --kind MongoDB \\\\\\n    --locations regionName=$REGION_ED345 failoverPriority=0 \\\\\\n    --default-consistency-level \\\"Session\\\" \\\\\\n    --enable-automatic-failover true\\n```\\n\\nConfigure throughput.\\n\\n```bash\\naz cosmosdb mongodb database create --account-name $COSMOS_DB_ACCOUNT_NAME_ED345 \\\\\\n    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME_ED345 \\\\\\n    --name \\\"AppDatabase\\\" \\\\\\n    --throughput $COSMOS_DB_THROUGHPUT_ED345\\n```\\n\\nThis command will output results similar to the following.\\n\\n<!-- expected_similarity=0.3 -->\\n\\n```text\\n{\\n    \\\"id\\\": \\\"/subscriptions/xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx/resourceGroups/ReactPythonMongoRG_xxxxxx/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/mongodbacct_xxxxxx\\\",\\n    \\\"name\\\": \\\"mongodbacct_xxxxxx\\\",\\n    \\\"type\\\": \\\"Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts\\\",\\n    \\\"location\\\": \\\"westus2\\\",\\n    \\\"properties\\\": {\\n        \\\"consistencyPolicy\\\": {\\n            \\\"defaultConsistencyLevel\\\": \\\"Session\\\"\\n        },\\n        \\\"provisioningState\\\": \\\"Succeeded\\\"\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAutoscale throughput can be enabled for dynamic workloads, but it may increase costs. Manual throughput is suitable for predictable workloads.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Step 5: Enable Azure Application Insights\\n\\nThis step enables Azure Application Insights to monitor the performance and health of the React web app and Python API.\\n\\nDefine environment variables for Application Insights.\\n\\n```bash\\nexport APP_INSIGHTS_NAME_ED345=\\\"AppInsights_$SUFFIX\\\"\\n```\\n\\nCreate Application Insights.\\n\\n```bash\\naz monitor app-insights component create --app $APP_INSIGHTS_NAME_ED345 \\\\\\n    --location $REGION_ED345 \\\\\\n    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME_ED345 \\\\\\n    --application-type \\\"web\\\"\\n```\\n\\nThis command will output results similar to the following.\\n\\n<!-- expected_similarity=0.3 -->\\n\\n```text\\n{\\n    \\\"id\\\": \\\"/subscriptions/xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx/resourceGroups/ReactPythonMongoRG_xxxxxx/providers/Microsoft.Insights/components/AppInsights_xxxxxx\\\",\\n    \\\"name\\\": \\\"AppInsights_xxxxxx\\\",\\n    \\\"type\\\": \\\"Microsoft.Insights/components\\\",\\n    \\\"location\\\": \\\"westus2\\\",\\n    \\\"properties\\\": {\\n        \\\"Application_Type\\\": \\\"web\\\",\\n        \\\"Flow_Type\\\": \\\"Bluefield\\\",\\n        \\\"Request_Source\\\": \\\"rest\\\"\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAdvanced telemetry options provide deeper insights but may increase costs. Basic monitoring is sufficient for most applications.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis concludes the deployment steps for the React-based web application architecture.\", \"passed_tests\": true}}, {\"py/object\": \"document.Section\", \"name\": \"Summary\", \"requires_test\": false, \"instance\": {\"py/object\": \"summary.Summary\", \"title\": \"Summary\", \"meta_data\": {}, \"content\": \"## Summary\\n\\nThis document detailed the architecture and step-by-step process for deploying a simple Python Flask application to Microsoft Azure using Azure App Service.
