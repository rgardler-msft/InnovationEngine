# Simple Flask (Python) Application on Azure

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture for deploying a simple Python Flask application to Microsoft Azure using Azure App Service. The application is designed for demonstration purposes, showcasing how a lightweight Flask-based website can be developed locally and then deployed to the cloud. This architecture is ideal for small-scale projects, prototypes, or educational purposes where ease of deployment and minimal infrastructure complexity are key priorities.

The deployment leverages Azure App Service, a fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web applications. This approach eliminates the need for managing underlying infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on the application itself. The infrastructure files provided in the project (`infra`) will facilitate the deployment process.

### Major Components

* **Resource Group** - A logical container in Azure that will house all the resources for the Flask application. This ensures that resources are organized and can be managed collectively.
* **Azure App Service** - The core hosting platform for the Flask application. This service will handle the deployment, scaling, and runtime environment for the Python-based web application.
* **App Service Plan** - Defines the compute resources and pricing tier for the Azure App Service. This determines the performance and scalability of the application.
* **Azure Storage Account (optional)** - If the application requires persistent storage for logs, files, or other data, an Azure Storage Account can be included. This is not mandatory for the basic deployment but may be added depending on application requirements.

### Decision Points

In this architecture, users will need to make several decisions to tailor the deployment to their needs. These decisions include:

1. **App Service Plan SKU**:
   - Users must choose a pricing tier for the App Service Plan, such as Free, Basic, Standard, or Premium. This decision will depend on factors like expected traffic, performance requirements, and budget.
   - For demonstration purposes, the Free or Basic tier may suffice, but production environments may require higher tiers for scalability and reliability.

2. **Region Selection**:
   - The Azure region where the resources will be deployed must be chosen. Factors include proximity to end users, compliance requirements, and cost differences between regions.

3. **Scaling Options**:
   - Users can configure scaling settings for the App Service, such as enabling autoscaling based on CPU usage or traffic. For a simple demonstration, manual scaling may be sufficient.

4. **Deployment Method**:
   - The application can be deployed using several methods, including GitHub Actions, Azure CLI, or Azure DevOps pipelines. The choice will depend on familiarity with tools and integration needs.

5. **Persistent Storage**:
   - If the application requires storage for logs or files, users must decide on the type of storage (e.g., Blob Storage, File Storage) and the performance tier.

### Alternatives

While this document focuses on deploying a Flask application using Azure App Service, there are alternative Azure-based solutions that may be considered depending on the project's requirements:

1. **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**:
   - For applications requiring container orchestration and more control over deployment, AKS can be used. This is ideal for microservices architectures or applications needing advanced scaling capabilities. However, it introduces more complexity compared to App Service.

2. **Azure Functions**:
   - If the Flask application is lightweight and event-driven, Azure Functions can be used to host the application as serverless functions. This approach is cost-effective for applications with sporadic traffic but may require refactoring the application.

3. **Virtual Machines**:
   - For complete control over the environment, users can deploy the Flask application on Azure Virtual Machines. This is suitable for legacy applications or scenarios requiring custom configurations but requires managing the underlying infrastructure.

Each alternative has its trade-offs in terms of complexity, scalability, and cost. For demonstration purposes, Azure App Service is the simplest and most straightforward option.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required before you are able to work through this document.

- Az CLI is installed and you are logged in to an active Azure subscription.

```bash
export SUFFIX=$(date +%s%N | sha256sum | head -c 6)
```

---

## Step 1: Create a Resource Group

The first step is to create a resource group, which acts as a logical container for all resources related to the Flask application. This ensures that resources are organized and can be managed collectively.

Define the environment variable for the resource group name and region:

```bash
export RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME_ED47="FlaskAppRG_$SUFFIX"
export REGION_ED47="westus2"
```

Create the resource group:

```bash
az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME_ED47 \
    --location $REGION_ED47
```

This command will output results similar to the following:

<!-- expected_similarity=0.3 -->

```text
{
    "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx/resourceGroups/FlaskAppRG_xxxxxx",
    "location": "westus2",
    "managedBy": null,
    "name": "FlaskAppRG_xxxxxx",
    "properties": {
        "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
    },
    "tags": null,
    "type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups"
}
```

The resource group provides a centralized way to manage resources, enabling easier monitoring, billing, and deletion of all associated resources. Ensure the region selected aligns with compliance and latency requirements for your application.

---

## Step 2: Create an App Service Plan

The App Service Plan defines the compute resources and pricing tier for the Azure App Service. For demonstration purposes, we'll use the Free tier.

Define the environment variables for the App Service Plan:

```bash
export APP_SERVICE_PLAN_NAME_ED47="FlaskAppPlan_$SUFFIX"
export APP_SERVICE_PLAN_SKU_ED47="F1" # Free tier
```

Create the App Service Plan:

```bash
az appservice plan create --name $APP_SERVICE_PLAN_NAME_ED47 \
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME_ED47 \
    --sku $APP_SERVICE_PLAN_SKU_ED47 \
    --is-linux
```

This command will output results similar to the following:

<!-- expected_similarity=0.3 -->

```text
{
    "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx/resourceGroups/FlaskAppRG_xxxxxx/providers/Microsoft.Web/serverfarms/FlaskAppPlan_xxxxxx",
    "location": "westus2",
    "name": "FlaskAppPlan_xxxxxx",
    "sku": {
        "name": "F1",
        "tier": "Free",
        "size": "F1",
        "family": "F",
        "capacity": 1
    },
    "type": "Microsoft.Web/serverfarms"
}
```

The Free tier is suitable for small-scale projects and demonstrations but has limitations in terms of scalability and performance. For production workloads, consider upgrading to Basic, Standard, or Premium tiers.

## Step 3: Create an Azure App Service

Azure App Service is the core hosting platform for the Flask application. This step deploys the web application environment.

Define the environment variables for the App Service:

```bash
export APP_SERVICE_NAME_ED47="FlaskApp$SUFFIX"
export RUNTIME_ED47="PYTHON|3.9"
```

Create the App Service:

```bash
az webapp create --name $APP_SERVICE_NAME_ED47 \
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME_ED47 \
    --plan $APP_SERVICE_PLAN_NAME_ED47 \
    --runtime $RUNTIME_ED47
```

This command will output results similar to the following:

<!-- expected_similarity=0.3 -->

```text
{
    "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx/resourceGroups/FlaskAppRG_xxxxxx/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/FlaskApp_xxxxxx",
    "location": "westus2",
    "name": "FlaskApp_xxxxxx",
    "state": "Running",
    "hostNames": [
        "FlaskApp_xxxxxx.azurewebsites.net"
    ],
    "type": "Microsoft.Web/sites"
}
```

The App Service provides a fully managed platform for hosting the Flask application. Ensure the runtime version matches the Python version used in your application.

---

## Step 4: Deploy the Flask Application

Deploy the Flask application to the Azure App Service using the Azure CLI. This step assumes you have the application files ready locally.

Define the environment variable for the deployment source path:

```bash
export DEPLOYMENT_SOURCE_PATH_ED47="/path/to/your/flask/app.zip"
```

Ensure the deployment source path points to a valid ZIP file containing your Flask application files. Update the `DEPLOYMENT_SOURCE_PATH_ED47` variable accordingly.

Deploy the application:

```bash
az webapp deploy --name $APP_SERVICE_NAME_ED47 \
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME_ED47 \
    --src-path $DEPLOYMENT_SOURCE_PATH_ED47 \
    --type zip
```

This command will output results similar to the following:

<!-- expected_similarity=0 -->

```text
{
    "active": true,
    "deploymentId": "xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx",
    "status": "Success"
}
```

The `--type zip` parameter ensures the deployment is treated as a ZIP package, which is suitable for Flask applications. For production deployments, consider integrating CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments.

---

## Step 5: Test the Application

After deployment, test the Flask application by accessing the URL provided in the output of the App Service creation step. For example:

```text
https://FlaskApp_xxxxxx.azurewebsites.net
```

You can also monitor the application using Azure Portal or Azure CLI commands to check its status and logs.

---

This deployment is optimized for simplicity and demonstration purposes. For production environments, consider scaling options, advanced monitoring, and integrating persistent storage solutions.
